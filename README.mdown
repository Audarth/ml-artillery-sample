# Artillery with Marklogic

The following are some sample artillery tests which can be used with Marklogic for load testing.

To use these first install artillery with:

	npm install -g artillery 

Go to the directory containing these files and modify 'insert.yml' and 'insert_distributed.yml' with your credentials, hostname and port.

Now run your preferred test (in this case insert.yml) using:

	artillery run insert.yml

Record your results and maybe clear, restart and try again!
